Music has been a passion of mine for almost a decade now, but my knowledge has improved significantly in the last 4 or so years. I generally choose to listen to rock music of many sub-genres but am also partial to other genres like hip hop, R&B, electronic music.

Typography is also a passion of mine, studying the uses and implimentations of different fonts in many different contexts, including in the artwork that accompanies music. With the link between music and art growing stronger ans stronger over the last 70 or so years, there has never been a more relevant time to examine the uses of typography within album cover arts, as well as other art accompanying musical projects. This was the motivating catalyst behind my website and blog.

I am taking a Media, Journalism and Publishing course currently which I find very interesting. Though journalism is my main goal (ideally music journalism), I enjoy all aspects of the course and look forward to being able to carve out my own pathway within the course.
