Music has been a passion of mine for almost a decade now, but my knowledge has improved significantly in the last 4 or so years. I generally choose to listen to rock music of many sub-genres but am also partial to other genres like hip hop, R&B, electronic music. I am taking a Media, Journalism and Publishing course currently which I find very interesting. Though journalism is my main goal (ideally music journalism), I enjoy all aspects of the course and look forward to being able to carve out my own pathway within the course.
