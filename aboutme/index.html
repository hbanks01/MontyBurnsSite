<h1>Some Information About Me!</h1>
<div class="intro">
<h5>Hi all. My name is Harry Banks and I am a 20 year old Media, Journalism & Publishing student at Oxford Brookes University. I am currently in my second year, which I am enjoying much more than my first year - which was interrupted dramatically by the Covid-19 Pandemic.</h5>

<h3>Interests and Hobbies</h3>
<div style="width: 100%">
  <div style="width: 50%; text-align: left;">
  
<p>One of my main interests is music. Since around 2016, I have been 
  listening to music every day whilst aiming to find new artists and 
  try to keep my mind as open as possible. Though rock is certainly the
   genre that dominates my record collection the most, it is not 
   uncommon to find records that fall under labels like ambient, techno,
    psychedelic jazz and several sub-genres of hip-hop. Some of my 
    favourite artists include Pink Floyd, King Krule, King Crimson 
    and Kanye West - the latter of which I feel has an underrated 
    discography due to his excessively public profile and numerous 
    controversies.</p>
    
    <p>An issue I grapple with in relation to music is the 
    seperation between art and artist in regards to their controversies,
     though I tend to draw the line at issues invloving genuine abuse 
     towards others.  Controversial opinions do not particularly impact 
     my enjoyment of music unless they involve marginalising or degrading 
     certain groups of people. </p>

<h4> Where am I from?</h4>
<p>I was born in Ashford, Kent in September 2001 - exactly 3 days after the 9/11 tragedy took place and changed the mechanisms by which our world functions. I was born at home but taken to hospital for monitoring as I had newborn jaundice. I spent nearly the first 6 years of my life in Kent before moving to Northampton in the Midlands. My immediate family have lived their ever since and so did I until my move to Oxford to study at Oxford Brookes University in 2020, though this was short-lived due to the pandemic. In September 2021 I moved to Oxford on a more permanent basis and now live with my two housemates; Ollie and Tom. I have loved living in Oxford so far as it is truly a city of culture and the residents generally facilitate an atmosphere of acceptance and friendliness.</p>
