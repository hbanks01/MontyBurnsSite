Album artworks can influence how certain projects permeate throughout culture and font selection is a large aspect of this. There are many iconic artists that have associated themselves with a particular aesthetic for extended periods of time; think of the iconic stylized font used for the AC/DC logo

 or the memorable yet minimal trademark font of fellow Australian music project Tame Impala (Microgramma).
